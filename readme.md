# Diffrent types of Attributes and Labels Drive Modeling Choices

There are various types of attributes, numeric variables and ategorical variables. Numeric variables is the most usual type of attribute. Categorical or Factor variables, have no order relation between the values. Many machine learning algorithms take numeric values only. They cannot handle categorical or factor variables.

Penalized regression algorothms deal only with numeric attributes. the same is true for support vector machines, kernel methods and K-nearest neighbours. 

The nature of the variables will shape your algorithms choices and the direction you take in developing a predicitive model, so it's one of the things you need to pay attention to when you face a new problem. Similiar dichotomy arises for labels. The labels can be numeric or categorical. 

Naming Conventions,

Attributes and labels go by a variety of names:

###### Attributes(the values used to make the predicitons) are kown as 

Predicitors

Features 

Independent Variables

Inputs 

###### Labels are also know as 

Outcomes 

Targets 

Dependent variables

Responses

Different types of Attributes and labels drive modelling choices, when labels are numeric the problem is called a regression problem. When the labels are categorical, the probelm is called a classification problem.
